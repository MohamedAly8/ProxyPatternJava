## Background Information

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used when we want to provide a simplified interface to a complex or resource-intensive object, or when we want to add additional functionality to an object while maintaining the same interface.

The Proxy Pattern can be used to solve a variety of problems, including controlling access to sensitive resources, providing caching for frequently accessed data, or adding logging or other instrumentation to an object. It can also be used to create virtual objects that are created on demand and only when needed, which can improve performance and reduce memory usage.

One of the key benefits of the Proxy Pattern is that it allows us to decouple the client code from the implementation details of the object being proxied. This makes it easier to change or replace the underlying object without affecting the client code. Additionally, the Proxy Pattern can help improve system performance by reducing the number of expensive resource requests and minimizing network traffic.
